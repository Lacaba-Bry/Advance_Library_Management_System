Story:
Janet carefully turned the knob to the CEO’s office, clutching her coffee, when she heard the faint sound of latex rubbing against the walls. As the door creaked open, she froze in disbelief—the entire room was stuffed with balloons of every color, bouncing gently with the air conditioning. “Who... what?” she whispered. Just then, Mark from Marketing appeared in the hallway, grinning sheepishly. “I may have left a little surprise for Dave’s birthday,” he admitted. Janet sighed but couldn’t help smiling. What started as a simple joke had quickly ignited a full-blown prank war, and now the whole office was buzzing with anticipation, everyone trying to guess who would outdo the balloon ambush next. The very next morning, Janet headed to the conference room to prepare for a meeting—and nearly dropped her notes when she spotted a goat calmly chewing on a paperclip right in the middle of the table, sporting a bright red tie around its neck. “Okay,” she muttered, stepping back, “Who gave Dave internet access again?” Laughter echoed down the hallway as employees peeked inside, phones already recording the surreal scene. Tim, the IT guy, gave her a thumbs-up from across the room. Dave appeared in the doorway, bewildered but amused. “Who’s responsible for this?” he asked, smirking. Janet joked, “No clue, but I think the goat’s a better employee than Steve from accounting.” As the week went on, the prank war spiraled wildly out of control. Tim unleashed his masterpiece: a virus that replaced every mouse cursor with a tiny dancing banana, causing screens everywhere to twitch with animated fruit. Sally retaliated by swapping everyone’s desk chairs for bouncy exercise balls, turning the office into a balancing act with more than one tumble causing fits of laughter. Janet tried to keep order but even she couldn’t resist sticking a “Kick Me” post-it on Dave’s coffee mug during a meeting. When Dave caught her red-handed, he raised an eyebrow and teased, “Trying to start a war, Janet?” “Just balancing the scales,” she replied with a grin. The prank war reached its peak during Friday’s afternoon break when Janet walked into the break room only to be met with a creamy pie smashed into her face. “Pie!” she sputtered, wiping whipped cream from her glasses. Dave appeared behind her, laughing and wiping pie off his own suit. “You’re all officially warned,” he said with a twinkle in his eye. “Next one of you gets me—and you’re organizing the next team event.” The office erupted with laughter, the pie incident a welcome release of tension rather than punishment. The following Monday brought a surprising change of pace when Dave called an all-hands meeting. “I’ve been thinking,” he said, “instead of fighting, why don’t we channel this energy into something fun for everyone?” The team organized a huge office party complete with a pie-eating contest, balloon animals, and even a karaoke machine. Pranks took a backseat to laughter and camaraderie. Janet raised her coffee cup during the toast. “To pranks, laughter, and a workplace where everyone belongs.” Months later, new hires were regaled with the story of the legendary balloon office and the goat in the conference room—a reminder that sometimes a little chaos is exactly what a team needs. Janet smiled, watching the new recruits giggle at the tales. “Welcome to KelmCo,” she thought, “where even the pranks have heart.”
