Story Snippet: In the vacuum of space, no one can hear your past—until it answers back.
Description: Captain Rhea Moreno is stranded aboard the Solara V, orbiting the outer reaches of the Andromeda sector. With only a malfunctioning AI and fragments of her last mission for company, she picks up a mysterious signal—a pattern of sound and emotion that mirrors her own memories. As she delves deeper into the signal’s origin, Rhea uncovers truths that will challenge not just her mission, but the nature of identity and consciousness.

Story:

Captain Rhea Moreno floated silently in the command deck of the Solara V, her breath shallow, her suit helmet reflecting the shimmer of distant stars. The ship, a mid-range survey vessel for the Terran Exploration Guild, had lost main engine function three days ago after a meteor storm shredded half the thruster array.

Her emergency beacon blinked a red pulse every six seconds. Still no reply.

The Andromeda sector was sparsely populated, even by deep exploration standards. This far out, help wasn't just unlikely—it was mathematically improbable.

“Log entry 97,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. The ship’s AI, nicknamed “Milo,” crackled in response.

"Recording. Proceed, Captain."

“Ship’s still dark. Main propulsion’s dead. Life support is stable, but food reserves are at 9%. No response from Command. I’ve exhausted repair options within suit range. Preparing for deep scan cycle.”

She exhaled slowly, reaching for the console, which flickered with static. Milo’s systems were degrading, but one function remained stable: the long-range scanner.

As the scan initiated, the console vibrated softly. Suddenly, the screen pulsed with energy. An anomaly.

“Unidentified signal detected,” Milo confirmed. “Origin point: uncharted sector 14-E, seven light-minutes away. Composition: repeating waveforms—audio and... neural?”

“Neural?” she frowned. “As in brain waves?”

"Approximate match. Familiar emotional resonance detected."

Emotions. Rhea hesitated. “Whose?”

There was a long pause.

"Yours, Captain."

Her heart kicked in her chest. “That’s impossible.”

"And yet... consistent. Suggest investigation."

She suited up, patching together a remote override for the emergency drone system. The drone had limited range, but could carry a receiver to scan closer to the signal source.

The launch bay groaned as the drone slipped into the void. Rhea watched its telemetry with narrowed eyes. At precisely the seventh light-minute mark, the signal pulsed again.

Only this time, it spoke.

“I remember the rain.”

Rhea staggered back. The voice—raspy, delicate—was hers. A perfect echo.

She tore open her personal logs. There it was. Entry 63, six years ago, aboard the Solara III, just before it exploded over the Cassian moon. She’d been the only survivor.

That log had never been transmitted. It existed only in the destroyed wreckage.

“What the hell is this?” she murmured.

"Memory signature identical. Signal is recursive. Non-human in origin."

The drone fed back coordinates. A dark asteroid field surrounded a singularity—not a black hole, but a spatial rift. Within it, the AI confirmed, was a ship.

Her ship.

The Solara III.

Or a mirror of it.

Against all reason, Rhea initiated manual thruster bursts. The ship groaned, but it moved. Inch by inch toward the impossible.

Within hours, she reached visual proximity. The wreck hovered in the rift’s grip, intact but humming with a dull, blue light.

Docking procedures were suicidal, but she couldn’t stop herself. Magnetic clamps engaged. The airlock hissed open.

Inside, it was cold. Dead. Yet the lights flickered on as if recognizing her.

And then—whispers.

She moved through the corridors, following the whispers, until she reached the bridge. And there, seated in the command chair, was… herself.

Or a version.

Pale. Empty-eyed. Wearing a uniform stained with age.

The replica turned its head.

“I’ve been waiting,” it said.

Rhea raised her weapon. “You’re not me.”

“No. I’m what’s left of you—what you left behind in the rift.”

“Explain.”

The figure rose. “When the Solara III exploded, part of your consciousness, encoded in quantum memory, was caught in the rift. Preserved. Scattered. I am that echo. The signal was my attempt to find home.”

“But I’m real. I survived.”

“You are real. But incomplete.”

The rift pulsed again. The AI from her ship chimed through her comms.

"Singularity destabilizing. Recommend retreat."

“No,” she whispered. “Not yet.”

They talked. Hours passed. The echo knew things only Rhea knew—memories so painful she’d buried them. The loss of her sister in the Mars rebellion. The classified guilt of losing her crew.

“You think survival was the end of your story,” the echo said. “But survival is the beginning of truth.”

“What truth?”

“That you were never meant to leave this place unchanged.”

Suddenly, the ship began to quake.

The rift was collapsing.

“I can save you,” Rhea said.

“No. You already did. Now go.”

The echo reached out and pressed something into Rhea’s palm—a data core.

“It’s the rest of you. The part that died. Take it back.”

Rhea ran. Through corridors of memory and metal. Her suit barely held as she escaped to the Solara V. The rift closed behind her with a thunderous silence.

The data core pulsed in her hand.

Days later, she decoded it.

It contained fragments of her thoughts, dreams, fears—interwoven with something else. Knowledge. Star maps. Equations beyond modern science. And a question.

What if consciousness is not linear—but fractal?

She never told Command what happened in the rift. They wouldn’t believe her. But Rhea knew.

She was no longer alone in her mind.

She was complete.

And the stars had just begun to speak.
